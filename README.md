# Okta API developer portal

:construction: WORK IN PROGRESS :construction:

## Prerequisites

- [node.js >= 12.22.6](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)

## Install

    yarn install

## Start development server

    yarn start

Note: search isn't functional in the development environment.

## Troubleshooting

We heavily rely on caching for performance issues so if some changes are not reflected in the resulting portal try cleaning cache by running:

    yarn clean

## Docs

Read the [online documentation](https://redoc.ly/docs/reference/introduction/).

## Scripts

The `scripts` directory contains scripts that preprocess specs for the API reference documentation.
